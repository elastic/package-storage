          These options allow you to filter out all processes that are not
          in the top N by CPU or memory, in order to reduce the number of documents created.
          If both the `by_cpu` and `by_memory` options are used, the union of the two sets
          is included. Set to false to disable this feature and include all processes

      - name: include_top_n.by_cpu
        default: 5
        type: int
        description: >
          How many processes to include from the top by CPU. The processes are sorted
                    by the `system.process.cpu.total.pct` field.

      - name: include_top_n.by_memory
        default: 5
        type: int
        description: >
          How many processes to include from the top by memory. The processes are sorted
          by the `system.process.memory.rss.bytes` field.


      - name: cmdline.cache.enabled
        default: true
        type: bool
        description: If false, cmdline of a process is not cached.

        multi: true
        description: >
          A list of regular expressions used to whitelist environment variables
          reported with the process metricset's events. Defaults to empty.

        default: false
        type: bool
        description: >
          Include the cumulative CPU tick values with the process metrics. Defaults
          to false.
