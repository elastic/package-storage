    ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events.
    When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events.

    This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy.
    `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory.
    This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories.

    Name of the dataset.
    If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from.
    It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name.
  name: event.dataset

    Duration of the event in nanoseconds.
    If event.start and event.end are known this value should be the difference between the end and start time.

    This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy.
    `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events.
    The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not.
  name: event.kind
  type: keyword
- description: event.start contains the date when the event started or when the activity was first observed.
  name: event.start

    This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy.
    `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization.
    This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types.

    Total bytes transferred in both directions.
    If `source.bytes` and `destination.bytes` are known, `network.bytes` is their sum.
  name: network.bytes
  type: long
- description: |-
    A hash of source and destination IPs and ports, as well as the protocol used in a communication. This is a tool-agnostic standard to identify flows.

    Direction of the network traffic.
    Recommended values are:
      * ingress
      * egress
      * inbound
      * outbound
      * internal
      * external
      * unknown

    When mapping events from a host-based monitoring context, populate this field from the host's point of view, using the values "ingress" or "egress".
    When mapping events from a network or perimeter-based monitoring context, populate this field from the point of view of the network perimeter, using the values "inbound", "outbound", "internal" or "external".
    Note that "internal" is not crossing perimeter boundaries, and is meant to describe communication between two hosts within the perimeter. Note also that "external" is meant to describe traffic between two hosts that are external to the perimeter. This could for example be useful for ISPs or VPN service providers.
