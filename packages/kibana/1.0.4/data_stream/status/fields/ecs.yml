    Date/time when the event originated.
    This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source.
    If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.
    Required field for all events.
  name: '@timestamp'
  type: date

    Unique identifier of the running service. If the service is comprised of many nodes, the `service.id` should be the same for all nodes.
    This id should uniquely identify the service. This makes it possible to correlate logs and metrics for one specific service, no matter which particular node emitted the event.
    Note that if you need to see the events from one specific host of the service, you should filter on that `host.name` or `host.id` instead.
  name: service.id

    Version of the service the data was collected from.
    This allows to look at a data set only for a specific version of a service.
  name: service.version
  type: keyword
- description: |-
    The type of the service data is collected from.
    The type can be used to group and correlate logs and metrics from one service type.
    Example: If logs or metrics are collected from Elasticsearch, `service.type` would be `elasticsearch`.
  name: service.type
  type: keyword
- description: |-
    Name of the service data is collected from.
    The name of the service is normally user given. This allows for distributed services that run on multiple hosts to correlate the related instances based on the name.
    In the case of Elasticsearch the `service.name` could contain the cluster name. For Beats the `service.name` is by default a copy of the `service.type` field if no name is specified.
  name: service.name

    ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events.
    When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events.
  name: ecs.version
