    Date/time when the event originated.
    This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source.
    If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.
    Required field for all events.
  name: '@timestamp'
  type: date
- description: |-
    Unique identifier of the running service. If the service is comprised of many nodes, the `service.id` should be the same for all nodes.
    This id should uniquely identify the service. This makes it possible to correlate logs and metrics for one specific service, no matter which particular node emitted the event.
    Note that if you need to see the events from one specific host of the service, you should filter on that `host.name` or `host.id` instead.
  name: service.id
  type: keyword
- description: |-
    Address where data about this service was collected from.
    This should be a URI, network address (ipv4:port or [ipv6]:port) or a resource path (sockets).
  name: service.address
  type: keyword
- description: |-
    Version of the service the data was collected from.
    This allows to look at a data set only for a specific version of a service.
  name: service.version
  type: keyword
- description: |-
    The type of the service data is collected from.
    The type can be used to group and correlate logs and metrics from one service type.
    Example: If logs or metrics are collected from Elasticsearch, `service.type` would be `elasticsearch`.
  name: service.type
  type: keyword
- description: |-
    ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events.
    When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events.
  name: ecs.version
  type: keyword
- description: Process id.
  name: process.pid
  type: long
- description: |-
    Name of the dataset.
    If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from.
    It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name.
  name: event.dataset
  type: keyword
- description: |-
    Duration of the event in nanoseconds.
    If event.start and event.end are known this value should be the difference between the end and start time.
  name: event.duration
  type: long
- description: |-
    Name of the module this data is coming from.
    If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module.
  name: event.module
  type: keyword
- description: |-
    Name of the host.
    It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use.
  name: host.name
  type: keyword
