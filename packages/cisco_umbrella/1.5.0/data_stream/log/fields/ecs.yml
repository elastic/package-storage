    This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy.
    `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event.
    Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective.
    Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer.
    Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense.

    Note that "internal" is not crossing perimeter boundaries, and is meant to describe communication between two hosts within the perimeter. Note also that "external" is meant to describe traffic between two hosts that are external to the perimeter. This could for example be useful for ISPs or VPN service providers.
