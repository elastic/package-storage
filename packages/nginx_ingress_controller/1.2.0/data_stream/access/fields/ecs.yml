    ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events.
    When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events.

    HTTP request method.
    Prior to ECS 1.6.0 the following guidance was provided:
    "The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying."
    As of ECS 1.6.0, the guidance is deprecated because the original case of the method may be useful in anomaly detection.  Original case will be mandated in ECS 2.0.0

    Some event source addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field.
    Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is.
