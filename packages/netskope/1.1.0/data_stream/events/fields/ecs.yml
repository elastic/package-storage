    Some event destination addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field.
    Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is.
  name: destination.address

    ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events.
    When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events.
  name: ecs.version
  type: keyword
- description: |-
    The action captured by the event.
    This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer.
  name: event.action
  type: keyword
- description: |-
    This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy.
    `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory.
    This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories.
  name: event.category
  type: keyword
- description: Unique ID to describe the event.
  name: event.id
  type: keyword
- description: |-
    This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy.
    `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events.
    The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not.
  name: event.kind
  type: keyword
- description: |-
    This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy.
    `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization.
    This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types.
