    ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events.

    Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store.
    This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event.
    In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` < `event.created` < `event.ingested`.
  name: event.ingested

    Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity or where the full log message (before splitting it up in multiple parts) may be required, e.g. for reindex.
    This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`. If users wish to override this and index this field, please see `Field data types` in the `Elasticsearch Reference`.

    HTTP request method.
    Prior to ECS 1.6.0 the following guidance was provided:
    "The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying."
    As of ECS 1.6.0, the guidance is deprecated because the original case of the method may be useful in anomaly detection.  Original case will be mandated in ECS 2.0.0

    Syslog numeric priority of the event, if available.

    For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer.
    For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event.
    If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message.

    A name given to an application level protocol. This can be arbitrarily assigned for things like microservices, but also apply to things like skype, icq, facebook, twitter. This would be used in situations where the vendor or service can be decoded such as from the source/dest IP owners, ports, or wire format.
    The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. See the documentation section "Implementing ECS".

    Direction of the network traffic.
    Recommended values are:
      * ingress
      * egress
      * inbound
      * outbound
      * internal
      * external
      * unknown

    When mapping events from a host-based monitoring context, populate this field from the host's point of view, using the values "ingress" or "egress".
    When mapping events from a network or perimeter-based monitoring context, populate this field from the point of view of the network perimeter, using the values "inbound", "outbound", "internal" or "external".
    Note that "internal" is not crossing perimeter boundaries, and is meant to describe communication between two hosts within the perimeter. Note also that "external" is meant to describe traffic between two hosts that are external to the perimeter. This could for example be useful for ISPs or VPN service providers.
