    ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events.
    When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events.
  name: ecs.version
  type: constant_keyword
  value: 8.6.0-dev
- description: |-
    This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy.
    `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event.
    Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective.
    Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer.
    Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense.

    Identifies the environment where the service is running.

  name: service.environment
  type: keyword
- description: |-
    Name of the service data is collected from.
    The name of the service is normally user given. This allows for distributed services that run on multiple hosts to correlate the related instances based on the name.
    In the case of Elasticsearch the `service.name` could contain the cluster name. For Beats the `service.name` is by default a copy of the `service.type` field if no name is specified.
  name: service.name
  type: keyword
- description: |-
    Name of a service node.
    This allows for two nodes of the same service running on the same host to be differentiated. Therefore, `service.node.name` should typically be unique across nodes of a given service.
    In the case of Elasticsearch, the `service.node.name` could contain the unique node name within the Elasticsearch cluster. In cases where the service doesn't have the concept of a node name, the host name or container name can be used to distinguish running instances that make up this service. If those do not provide uniqueness (e.g. multiple instances of the service running on the same host) - the node name can be manually set.

    Domain of the url, such as "www.elastic.co".
    In some cases a URL may refer to an IP and/or port directly, without a domain name. In this case, the IP address would go to the `domain` field.
