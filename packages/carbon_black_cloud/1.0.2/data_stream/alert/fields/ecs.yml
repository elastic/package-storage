    ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events.
    When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events.
  name: ecs.version
  type: keyword
- description: event.end contains the date when the event ended or when the activity was last observed.
  name: event.end
  type: date
- description: Unique ID to describe the event.
  name: event.id

    This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy.
    `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events.
    The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not.
  name: event.kind
  type: keyword
- description: |-
    Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity or where the full log message (before splitting it up in multiple parts) may be required, e.g. for reindex.
    This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`. If users wish to override this and index this field, please see `Field data types` in the `Elasticsearch Reference`.
  doc_values: false
  index: false
  name: event.original
  type: keyword
- description: |-
    Reason why this event happened, according to the source.
    This describes the why of a particular action or outcome captured in the event. Where `event.action` captures the action from the event, `event.reason` describes why that action was taken. For example, a web proxy with an `event.action` which denied the request may also populate `event.reason` with the reason why (e.g. `blocked site`).
  name: event.reason
  type: keyword
- description: |-
    The numeric severity of the event according to your event source.
    What the different severity values mean can be different between sources and use cases. It's up to the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across events from the same source.
    The Syslog severity belongs in `log.syslog.severity.code`. `event.severity` is meant to represent the severity according to the event source (e.g. firewall, IDS). If the event source does not publish its own severity, you may optionally copy the `log.syslog.severity.code` to `event.severity`.
  name: event.severity
  type: long
- description: event.start contains the date when the event started or when the activity was first observed.
  name: event.start
  type: date
- description: |-
    URL linking to an external system to continue investigation of this event.
    This URL links to another system where in-depth investigation of the specific occurrence of this event can take place. Alert events, indicated by `event.kind:alert`, are a common use case for this field.
  name: event.url
  type: keyword
- description: |-
    Hostname of the host.
    It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine.
  name: host.hostname
  type: keyword
- description: |-
    Unique host id.
    As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment.
    Example: The current usage of `beat.name`.
  name: host.id
  type: keyword
- description: Host ip addresses.
  name: host.ip
  type: ip
- description: |-
    Name of the host.
    It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use.
  name: host.name
  type: keyword
- description: |-
    Use the `os.type` field to categorize the operating system into one of the broad commercial families.
    One of these following values should be used (lowercase): linux, macos, unix, windows.
    If the OS you're dealing with is not in the list, the field should not be populated. Please let us know by opening an issue with ECS, to propose its addition.
  name: host.os.type
  type: keyword
- description: Operating system version as a raw string.
  name: host.os.version
  type: keyword
- description: |-
    Unique identifier for the process.
    The implementation of this is specified by the data source, but some examples of what could be used here are a process-generated UUID, Sysmon Process GUIDs, or a hash of some uniquely identifying components of a process.
    Constructing a globally unique identifier is a common practice to mitigate PID reuse as well as to identify a specific process over time, across multiple monitored hosts.
  name: process.entity_id
  type: keyword
- description: Absolute path to the process executable.
  multi_fields:
    - name: text
      type: match_only_text
  name: process.executable

    Process name.
    Sometimes called program name or similar.
  multi_fields:
    - name: text
      type: match_only_text
  name: process.name
  type: keyword
- description: All the hashes seen on your event. Populating this field, then using it to search for hashes can help in situations where you're unsure what the hash algorithm is (and therefore which key name to search).
  name: related.hash
  type: keyword
- description: All hostnames or other host identifiers seen on your event. Example identifiers include FQDNs, domain names, workstation names, or aliases.
  name: related.hosts
  type: keyword
- description: All of the IPs seen on your event.
  name: related.ip
  type: ip
- description: All the user names or other user identifiers seen on the event.
  name: related.user
  type: keyword
- description: List of keywords used to tag each event.
  name: tags

    Name of the directory the user is a member of.
    For example, an LDAP or Active Directory domain name.
  name: user.domain

    - name: text
