    ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events.
    When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events.

    event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline.
    This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event.
    In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source.
    In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used.

    Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity or where the full log message (before splitting it up in multiple parts) may be required, e.g. for reindex.
    This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`. If users wish to override this and index this field, please see `Field data types` in the `Elasticsearch Reference`.

    This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy.
    `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event.
    Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective.
    Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer.
    Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense.
  name: event.outcome
  type: keyword
- description: |-
    Reason why this event happened, according to the source.
    This describes the why of a particular action or outcome captured in the event. Where `event.action` captures the action from the event, `event.reason` describes why that action was taken. For example, a web proxy with an `event.action` which denied the request may also populate `event.reason` with the reason why (e.g. `blocked site`).

    Unmodified original url as seen in the event source.
    Note that in network monitoring, the observed URL may be a full URL, whereas in access logs, the URL is often just represented as a path.
    This field is meant to represent the URL as it was observed, complete or not.
