    ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events.
    When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events.

    Details about the event's logging mechanism or logging transport.
    The log.* fields are typically populated with details about the logging mechanism used to create and/or transport the event. For example, syslog details belong under `log.syslog.*`.
    The details specific to your event source are typically not logged under `log.*`, but rather in `event.*` or in other ECS fields.

        Original log level of the log event.
        If the source of the event provides a log level or textual severity, this is the one that goes in `log.level`. If your source doesn't specify one, you may put your event transport's severity here (e.g. Syslog severity).
        Some examples are `warn`, `err`, `i`, `informational`.
