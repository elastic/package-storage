    ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events.
    When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events.

    HTTP request method.
    Prior to ECS 1.6.0 the following guidance was provided:
    "The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying."
    As of ECS 1.6.0, the guidance is deprecated because the original case of the method may be useful in anomaly detection.  Original case will be mandated in ECS 2.0.0

    This value must only be populated based on the content of the response body, not on the `Content-Type` header. Comparing the mime type of a response with the response's Content-Type header can be helpful in detecting misconfigured servers.

    Some event source addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field.
    Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is.

    Domain of the url, such as "www.elastic.co".
    In some cases a URL may refer to an IP and/or port directly, without a domain name. In this case, the IP address would go to the `domain` field.
    If the URL contains a literal IPv6 address enclosed by `[` and `]` (IETF RFC 2732), the `[` and `]` characters should also be captured in the `domain` field.

    The field contains the file extension from the original request url, excluding the leading dot.
    The file extension is only set if it exists, as not every url has a file extension.
    The leading period must not be included. For example, the value must be "png", not ".png".
    Note that when the file name has multiple extensions (example.tar.gz), only the last one should be captured ("gz", not "tar.gz").

    The query field describes the query string of the request, such as "q=elasticsearch".
    The `?` is excluded from the query string. If a URL contains no `?`, there is no query field. If there is a `?` but no query, the query field exists with an empty string. The `exists` query can be used to differentiate between the two cases.
