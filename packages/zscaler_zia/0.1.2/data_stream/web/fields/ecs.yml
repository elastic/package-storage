    ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events.
    When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events.
  name: ecs.version
  type: keyword
- description: |-
    The action captured by the event.
    This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer.
  name: event.action
  type: keyword
- description: Risk score or priority of the event (e.g. security solutions). Use your system's original value here.

    HTTP request method.
    The value should retain its casing from the original event. For example, `GET`, `get`, and `GeT` are all considered valid values for this field.
  name: http.request.method
  type: keyword
- description: |-
    Mime type of the body of the request.
    This value must only be populated based on the content of the request body, not on the `Content-Type` header. Comparing the mime type of a request with the request's Content-Type header can be helpful in detecting threats or misconfigured clients.
  name: http.request.mime_type
  type: keyword
- description: Referrer for this HTTP request.
  name: http.request.referrer
  type: keyword
- description: Total size in bytes of the response (body and headers).

  name: http.response.status_code

    In the OSI Model this would be the Application Layer protocol. For example, `http`, `dns`, or `ssh`.
    The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying.

- description: |-
    Domain of the url, such as "www.elastic.co".
    In some cases a URL may refer to an IP and/or port directly, without a domain name. In this case, the IP address would go to the `domain` field.
    If the URL contains a literal IPv6 address enclosed by `[` and `]` (IETF RFC 2732), the `[` and `]` characters should also be captured in the `domain` field.
  name: url.domain
  type: keyword
- description: |-
    The field contains the file extension from the original request url, excluding the leading dot.
    The file extension is only set if it exists, as not every url has a file extension.
    The leading period must not be included. For example, the value must be "png", not ".png".
    Note that when the file name has multiple extensions (example.tar.gz), only the last one should be captured ("gz", not "tar.gz").
  name: url.extension
  type: keyword
- description: |-
    Portion of the url after the `#`, such as "top".
    The `#` is not part of the fragment.
  name: url.fragment
  type: keyword
- description: |-
    Unmodified original url as seen in the event source.
    Note that in network monitoring, the observed URL may be a full URL, whereas in access logs, the URL is often just represented as a path.
    This field is meant to represent the URL as it was observed, complete or not.
  multi_fields:
    - name: text
      type: match_only_text

  name: url.port
  type: long
- description: |-
    The query field describes the query string of the request, such as "q=elasticsearch".
    The `?` is excluded from the query string. If a URL contains no `?`, there is no query field. If there is a `?` but no query, the query field exists with an empty string. The `exists` query can be used to differentiate between the two cases.
