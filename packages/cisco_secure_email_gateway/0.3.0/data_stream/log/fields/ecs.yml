    The name being queried.
    If the name field contains non-printable characters (below 32 or above 126), those characters should be represented as escaped base 10 integers (\DDD). Back slashes and quotes should be escaped. Tabs, carriage returns, and line feeds should be converted to \t, \r, and \n respectively.

    ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events.

    This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy.
    `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event.
    Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective.
    Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer.
    Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense.
  name: event.outcome
  type: keyword
- description: |-
    Reason why this event happened, according to the source.
    This describes the why of a particular action or outcome captured in the event. Where `event.action` captures the action from the event, `event.reason` describes why that action was taken. For example, a web proxy with an `event.action` which denied the request may also populate `event.reason` with the reason why (e.g. `blocked site`).
  name: event.reason
  type: keyword
- description: |-
    HTTP request method.
    The value should retain its casing from the original event. For example, `GET`, `get`, and `GeT` are all considered valid values for this field.

    Original log level of the log event.
    If the source of the event provides a log level or textual severity, this is the one that goes in `log.level`. If your source doesn't specify one, you may put your event transport's severity here (e.g. Syslog severity).
    Some examples are `warn`, `err`, `i`, `informational`.
  name: log.level
  type: keyword
- description: |-
    Syslog numeric priority of the event, if available.
    According to RFCs 5424 and 3164, the priority is 8 * facility + severity. This number is therefore expected to contain a value between 0 and 191.
  name: log.syslog.priority
