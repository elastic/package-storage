    For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer.
    For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event.
    If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message.

    ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events.
