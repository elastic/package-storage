    The domain name of the destination system.

- description: |-
    The highest registered destination domain, stripped of the subdomain.
    For example, the registered domain for "foo.example.com" is "example.com".

    The subdomain portion of a fully qualified domain name includes all of the names except the host name under the registered_domain.

    For example the subdomain portion of "www.east.mydomain.co.uk" is "east". If the domain has multiple levels of subdomain, such as "sub2.sub1.example.com", the subdomain field should contain "sub2.sub1", with no trailing period.
