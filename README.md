# Package Storage
This is a storage repository for the packages served through the [package registry](https://github.com/elastic/package-registry) service.

It contains 3 branches with the packages for the different environments:

* snapshot
* staging
* production

Here's how these branches relate to repositories and other aspects of packages.
